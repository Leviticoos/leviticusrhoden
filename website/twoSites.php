First Steps
</h2>
<p>
I first started by following [1] to set up my raspberry Pi headlessly. I also followed [2] to download both apache and PHP to said raspberry pi. Next, I followed my own page to set up dynamic IP routing with namecheap. I followed [4] to set up ddclient. [3] at this point says to have both domains point at the home server.

    <dd>The big takeaway from my first reference to this source is that you can set up "virtual hosts" in apache, which will allow you to have two server instances on one server. I will be following this idea in order to have two servers running off my one Pi.</dd>

    <dd>Great, no nonsense article about setting up a micro SD card for a headless Pi. It's what I follow to use PuTTY to SSH in.</dd>
