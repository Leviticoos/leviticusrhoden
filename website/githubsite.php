<h2>
First subheading, often Introduction
</h2>
<p>
First Paragraph. This is meant to be a copy and paste-able file so I can use the same code to make a page and embed stuff in it. Essentially, it's where I test out any code I want to use.
</p><p>
Second paragraph, notice the double line break after.
</p><br><br>

<h2>
Another Subheading
</h2>
<p>
Paragraph 1.
</p><p>
Paragraph 2. This one I made longer to showcase how it drops down a line, it's quite interesting. Also appreciate <a href="hostingpi.php">this link</a> as an example of link html. Remember to put a <b>../</b> in the address for each step back in the directories you need to go from the current page before you can go down a branch to the page you want.

Examples of Embedding

<figcaption>
    An example of an embeded image that I resize to either 350px or 500px wide, to save space, bandwidth, and so I don't have to mess with scaling html-side.

Figure 1, A .gif of a fluid simulation I programmed. If you look closely you can see it did not work!

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20220323015114if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/CUZq7yudbSU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<figcaption>
Figure 2, One of my best YouTube videos! Embedding it on your own is a pain, but YouTube has a handy html generator function, so it takes care of it all. Both img and iframe are centered in the styles.css file.
