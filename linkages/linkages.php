    Linkages! People still care about them, I'm sure of it! Right? Well, I'm doing a bit of stuff involving 'em, so I figured I'd make a page. Future projects include a linkage calculator, which has a funky angle averager thing I'll also detail here. And hopefully I'll have a decent collection of 4-Bar function generators, with things like log(x), log(log(x)), etc.

    This device takes to rotational inputs, and returns a weighted average of the input angles. This will hopefully act as the core of a calculator of sorts.

    I stole a 4-Bar mechanism!!!!
