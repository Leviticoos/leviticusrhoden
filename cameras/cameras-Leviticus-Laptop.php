    This is the main page for my camera projects, which is a quickly expanding hobby of mine.

    <a href="developing.php">COMING SOON: How I Develop B&W Film</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Here I go into the steps I follow to develop B&W film, as well as some past sucsesses and failures and what they taught me.

<h2>
<a href="digichrome.php">WIP Digichrome</a>
</h2>
<p>
This page will eventually tell the story of digichrome, my attempt at making a semi-digital Autochrome-esqe way to get color photos from black and white film. There are many reasons I want to do this, but the main reason is it sounded like a fun project. However, this project is on hold while I work on some other projects that will be good prerequisites for it. See <a href='thinlenssim.php'>this thin lens simulation</a> as an example.

    <a href="pony_135_tuneup.php">Pony 135 Tune-up</a>
</h2>
<p>
    This page chronicles my amateur look at a Kodak pony 135 camera, as I try to clean it and verify that it is in working order. It also ended up being the beginning of my new camera obsession. I had to move it from crafting to a new dedicated camera subsection!

<h2>
<a href="thinlenssim.php">COMING SOON: Thin Lens Simulator</a>
</h2>
<p>
A thin lens simulator? Well, it would be thick lens, if I had more data on the lenses I was considering purchasing. No matter, this is a good starting point, and it'll hopefully be helpful to someone else! Not to mention, I feel like I've stumbled upon a new way to look at thin lenses.
