<h2>
What Loco is This?
</h2>
<p>
This little guy is an 0-4-0 switcher locomotive, that my friend Brooks let me have. The reason he let me have it is that she did not run. But, I've fixed up locos before, and in fact I quite enjoy it. So I tried to open it up and get it running smoothly again! The other hope is to try my hand at model painting the unit. While Great Northern never actually had any 0-4-0s on their roster, I think this is a great chance to try painting a model with a given livery.

<h2>
Adding a Belpaire Firebox
</h2>
<p>
It turns out, GN was known for building locos with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belpaire_firebox">Belpaire fireboxes</a>, which give the boiler that boxy section at the end, attached to the cab. While not all GN locos had it, the later ones did, and it seems like one of the ways

<h2>
A Fresh Coat of Paint
</h2>
<p>
I was caught off guard how hard it was to find color photos of G.N.s switchers before they were all painted black. Like I mentioned before, GN never ran a 0-4-0, but even the trains they had are hard to find with simple googling. I guess switchers are less fun than the large mainline engines. But, we do have this color photo of a faded livery, curtesy of TODO. Seriously though, if it was not for people like this, so much history would be lost.

<p>
From this I had a few good takeaways. While I'm not going to trust the color, as it seems to be a faded version of the standard GN <i>steam green</i>, it's locations will guide how I paint up this 0-4-0. The green goes along the boiler from the cab to smokestack cavity, and also adorns

Paragraph 2. This one I made longer to showcase how it drops down a line, it's quite interesting. Also appreciate <a href="hostingpi.php">this link</a> as an example of link html. Remember to put a <b>../</b> in the address for each step back in the directories you need to go from the current page before you can go down a branch to the page you want.
