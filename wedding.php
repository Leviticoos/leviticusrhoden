Wedding Party

<h2>Best Man: Asa Rhoden</h2>
    <p>
        Asa is Levi's younger brother and friend since birth. Through many adventures throughout both childhood and early adulthood, Asa has grown closer to his brother and can confidently say he’s the best brother and friend he could have asked for. Asa is currently attending the same university that Levi graduated from (UW!) and enjoys all the same dorky things he enjoys too. Asa is absolutely honored to be the best man for the wedding and hopes to do right by both bride and groom.
    </p><br>
<h2>Maid of Honor: Laura Skinner</h2>
<p>Laura is Emma's best (and most annoying*) friend. She met Emma on move in weekend in freshman year of college and the two bonded over their shared love of knitting. Many years later they have had many adventures together, and Laura has hopefully shared enough pasta to make up for eating it all that first night in the dorms.</p>
<p>*Since Laura is writing this she can say that</p><br>
<h2>Groomsmen:</h2>
<h3>Evan Truesdale</h3>
    <img src="photos/evan.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>
Evan first encountered Levi in their first quarter of college under the tutelage of "The Captain" and were jointly perplexed by Alex eating a whole pineapple. He is an enthusiast of all things nerdy and is easily distracted by shiny rocks and rotund birbs. He lived in the sacred meeting grounds of the Bean House with Levi for three years and with Emma for two. He is grateful to be a part of their lives and looks forward to seeing what wonders life holds for them.
</p><br>
<h3>Brooks Lee</h3>
<h3>Alex Lillian</h3>
<p>Alex is a San Diego native that had the great fortune to take a class with Mr. Rhoden durning their first quarter in collage. The two came together after sailing through English class with three other hooligans. Alex's greatest contribution to this crew was his organization of the table top games that helped keep the gang together for years durning the lockdown. Alex is passionate about games, but his true domain is the gym. Levi and Alex are early morning staples of the UW gym. All in all Alex has known Levi through years of coffee and cider, spears and swords, characters and classes, life and loss.</p><br>
<h3>Ryan Horn</h3>
<p>Ryan had the incredible luck to meet Levi in their freshman year of college, both studying at the University of Washington’s College of Engineering. Facilitated by a mixture of homemade rules to board games, early-morning overlaps in analytical math homework, and three years of roommate shenanigans, Ryan’s friendship with Levi (and Emma!) has grown to be close to brotherhood. </p>
<p>
Ryan is very approachable and would be more than happy to meet you after the ceremony! He loves D&D, cooking, hiking, camping, coffee, medical science, jokes, and (most importantly) everyone else on this website! If Levi’s wedding was a movie, Ryan would be the “Jack Black” to Levi’s “Tom Cruise”. If Levi’s wedding was a superhero movie, Ryan would be the “Spider-Man” to Levi’s “Cooler Spider-Man”. If Levi’s wedding was happening in December, Ryan would be there.
</p></br>
<h2>Bridesmaids:</h2>
<h3>Kara Atiyeh</h3>
<img src="photos/IMG_7617.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Kara is a senior studying Environmental Science at Portland State University, in other words, she is obsessed with exploring the outdoors. She met Emma as a freshman in the dorms at PSU, and since then, they’ve spent most of their time either exploring the city, binge-watching Netflix shows, or baking sweet treats to snack on (and potentially ignoring any and all homework in the process). She met Levi through Emma and has loved getting to know him over the years. She can't wait to see their journey together continue to grow!</p><br>
<h3>Sara Miller</h3>
<p>Sara is Emma's younger sister by four years. She's excited to be part of the day.</p><br>
<h3>Kaden Lee</h3>
<img src="photos/K.jpf" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Hello! My name is Kaden/Kay (they/them). I’m a Structures Analyst at Boeing and a recent grad of University of Washington. I adore trivia (I was on Jeopardy!) and spend most of my free time rock climbing and playing too many board games. I met Levi freshman year in our shared Oceanic Literature class and was immediately looped into a yearslong dnd game with him. When he introduced me to Emma, I immediately realized that I had met two very special people. I’m so thankful to have met these little lovebirds and I could not be more happy to be one of Emma’s Bridesmaids.</p><br>
<h3>Eileen Arata</h3>
<img src="Eileen_photo_copy.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>I'm just a huge Disney fan looking forward to seeing Levi and Emma live their happily ever after! I've known Levi since we met in the dorms freshman year at UW, and I met Emma at the same time since he was FaceTiming her (as always). Four years and many stories later, we're still all hanging out, and I can't wait to be a part of their big day.</p>

Hotels
</h1>
<p>
While we do not have a block of rooms reserved at a specific hotel, we do have recomendations for hotels! Our recomendations are in Marysville, which is equidistant from Snohomish (where we are having the ceremony) and Arlington (where we are having our reception). It is also sandwitched on the left by I-5, the main artery into Seattle, and on the right by SR 9, which runs from Arlington to snohomish and over to I-405. It is a bit north of Everett as well.
