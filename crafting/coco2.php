Welcome to my Omnibus page for the TRS-80, or the Color Computer 2, CoCo 2 for short, and affectionately called the Tandy by my family. Here I'm going to record all my expirementation, partly to catch myself up to speed when I pull this thing out from the china cabinet once again, and I forget what programs I use to view the darn thing!

I'll fill this out later, but I think the main theme is use an analog to USB converter, which they don't make anymore but you can get old stock on EBAY. Make sure it's specifically analog TV, as current over the air tv is digital and uses a different encoding method. Then use VLC media player to read from that USB and display it.

Figure 2, One of my best YouTube videos! Embedding it on your own is a pain, but YouTube has a handy html generator function, so it takes care of it all. Both img and iframe are centered in the styles.css file.
