    Welcome to my crafting homepage, the real bread and butter of my weekend projects. While crafting these days generally has a more paper and glue type of vibe, the word really means anything that a craftsman would make. It is that sense of the word that fits this page. Somewhere between tinkering, inventing, and modern crafting falls this page, and I hope you will have fun perusing the different articles here. Maybe it'll even give some inspiration!

<h2><a href="nonPlanar3D.php">COMING SOON: Non Planar 3D Printing</a></h2>
<p>
    A simple set of python scripts that generate GCODE for an Ender 3 printer, where you can have each layer surface transition from planar at the base to a function.

    <a href="3d_minis.php">3D Printed Minis on an Ender 3</a>
</h2>
<p>
    A simple overview of the settings for Cura and my Ender 3 printer that have good results printing minis for board and tabletop games. Not too detailed, just a list of numbers and suggestions for my future self and anyone intrested.

    <a href="pony_135_tuneup.php">Pony 135 Camera Tuneup</a>
</h2>
<p>
    The adventure of trying to clean and fix an old Kodak Pony 135 Model B film camera! I got it for $20 at an antique store, as I've wanted to get into film photography for quite a while. I originally wasn't going to make a page about it, but I ended up finding a new way to calibrate the focus after opening up the lens assembly, and want it to be available for others if they find themselves in my position.

<h2>
<a href="recordplayer.php">Record Player Battery</a>
</h2>
<p>
This page chronicles my successful attempt at putting a battery into my record player. No longer am I a servant to outlets and clunky ac-dc adapters.
</p><br><br>

<h2>
<a href="recordplayer2.php">Record Player Platter</a>
</h2>
<p>
A half arsed attempt at making a new record player platter. While it is not the best handiwork I've done, it is better than the original. And hey, now I know where to start when I try it again!
</p><br><br>

<h2>
<a href="hpEnvyFix.php">HP Envy 13-aqxxxx Retaining Clip</a>
</h2>
<p>
My laptop had a problem where the bottom plate was slowly coming off the rest of the computer, and I couldn't open it up to fix it. So, I made an outside mounting 3D printed clip to keep it together.
