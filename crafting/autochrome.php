<h2>
What do I Want to Do with This Idea?
</h2>
<p>
After watching a Technology Connections video, I wanted to try and use the same general principle for 35mm black and white photography. Step one is to make the color filter separate from the film. I want to load in Black and White film and not have to think about coating it in a darkroom or anything. This means a separate, camera-side filter is in order. Now, the problem with that is you need the exact same color filter to view the image in color, and it will be stuck in the camera. But since I digitally scan all of my prints anyway, we can try and scan the color filter, and then digitally overlay it on the photo scans. Thus, we can digitally bring color to black and white photos!
