<h2>
Bion's Construction
</h2>
<blockquote><p>
There are several Sorts of Compasses, of which we shall speak more fully hereafter; but that whose Uses we intend to lay down in this chapter, is the common Pair of Compasses. Of these Compasses there are two kinds, viz. Simple ones, which have their Points fixed, and others whose Points may be taken off; both kinds being of diffrent Bignesses, but they are commonly in Length from three to six Inches. To these Compasses, that shift their Points, there belongs a drawing Pen-Point, a Pencil-Point, and sometimes a Dotting-Wheel, to make dotted Lines.
</p><p>
The Goodness of Compasses consists chiefly in this, That the Motion of their Head be very equable, that so they may not leap in opening and shutting; that the Joints be well fitted; that they are well filed and polished; and, lastly, that the Steel-Points are well joined and equal. The Figure A sheweth these kinds of Compasses, whose Construction we shall give in the third book.

<blockquote><p>
Having already treated of Common Compasses, usually put into Cases of Instruments, we proceed now to mention some others, sometimes likewise placed in Cases of diffrent Bignesses.
</p>
<em>The Construction of Hoir-Compasses.</em>
<p>
These Compasses ore so called, because of a Contrivance in the Body of them, by means of which an Extent may be taken to a hair's Breadth. We have before hinted, that the Goodness of Compasses consists chiefly in havintg the Motion of their Head sufficently easy, and that they open and shut very equally; and that they may do so, the Joints ought to be well slit, and wery equal in Thickness.
</p><p>
The Manner of constructing the Joints, is thus: We first, with a Steel-Sow, slit the Head in two places, so that there remains a Middle-Piece, the Thickness of a Cord; then we slit the other Leg of the Compasses, in the Middle of the Joint, to recive the Middle-Piece that they may be well joined every where. This being done, we drill a round Hole thorow the Middle of the Head, in Bigness proportional to that of the Compasses, for the Rivot to go through; the Rivet ought to be very round, and exactly fill the aforesaid Hole. When we have rivetted it, the Head of the Compasses must be warmed, and a little yellow Wax poured between the Joints, for lessening the Friction of the Logs in opening and shutting. Lastly, we gently put upon the Head two turned Cheexs, serving for Counter-Rivets, and to preserve the Head.
</p><p>
The little Screw at the Bottom of the Body of these Hoir-Compasses, is to mave the Steel Point backwords or forwards, ath pleasure: this Point is fastened to the Top of the eCompasses by two Rivets, so that in turning the Screw it springs. The other Steel Point must be soldered to the other Leg, as all other Points of Compasses are that are fixed. Now to fit these Points for soldering, they must be filed so, as to go into two Slits made in the Bottom of the Bodf of the Compasses, that there they may be well joined, and the Solder strongly hold them.
</p><p>
<em>Note,</em> Solder is commonly made with Silver and Thirds of Copper, that is, twice more Silver than Copper: For Example; with one Dram of Silver, we mix half a Dram of Copper, wdich must be first melted in a Crucible, and afterwards, when cold, hammered to about the Thickness of a Cord, and cut into small Pieces that it may be sooner run, when there is use for it. Solder is likewise often made with Copper and Zink mixed together, viz. In melting 3/4 of Copper, with 1/4 of Zink: In solderng, we use Borax finely bruified, which makes the Losder better run and penetrate the Joints, or any thing else to be soldered.
