This section is dedicated to the research I've been doing at UW - from what the heck Pilot Wave Hydrodynamics even is to the machine I've built to study it, as well as a bit of computer simulation.

This page goes over what I'm researching at the University of Washington.

<h2><a href="shaker.php">Oil Bath Shaker</a></h2>
<p>
    Here I show off the bare bones oil shaker I built to run experiments on. It involves a simple setup with a speaker, as well as a self-designed method of attaching different-shaped dishes to hold oil, to run different expirements. I had to consider easy production, so the dishes are 3D printed. I also had to make them secure tightly, without needing to apply too much force to install or remove.

<p>
Whether you pronounce it gif or gif, this page is quite honestly very pretty to look at. It is a place for me to put a bunch of them, with some descriptions and explanations. It is mostly so I can pull it up when talking to professors and the like, but it's a website, so you can see it, too!
